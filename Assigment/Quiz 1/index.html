Trevor explains how he grew up in a black neighborhood in a black country. He explains how he had travelled to many black cities in black countries all over the continent but has never found a place where black people like cats. He gives an incident during an Orlando Pirates Soccer where a cat had entered into a stadium in a crowd but when the security guard saw it all that he decided to do was to kill it. The whites could not persevere with the guard and they decided to have him caught up and sent to jail. The guard who was a black person decided to defend himself saying that a cat was a sign of witchcraft but no one was on his side. This incident sounds like a joke because every group defended itself.</p>
